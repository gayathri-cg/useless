# NOKKI IRUNNO IPPO VARUM üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TechTwins


### Team Members

### Project Description
"Nokki irunno, ippo varum‚Äù is a gloriously useless website that translates ‚Äú5 minutes away‚Äù into the real arrival time using a completely fake (but deeply satisfying) algorithm. It won‚Äôt make anyone punctual, but it will make you feel like the petty time detective you always wanted to be.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People lie about being ‚Äúalmost there,‚Äù and we absolutely needed a fake science tool to call them out for it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A completely made-up algorithm that turns their polite little time-lie into a brutally honest, ego-crushing ETA
